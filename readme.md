# ðŸš€ AI6 (AI Saturday) Class Notebook Repository

Welcome to my AI6 cohort notebook! Here you'll find my journey through projects, assignments, and resources as I dive into the world of AI with the vibrant and inspiring AI Saturday Lagos community.

## Projects

1. **Webscraping (thedivashop.ng)**  
    - Building a scraper to explore inventory data from an ecommerce storeâ€”super excited to uncover valuable insights!

2. *(More awesome projects coming soon!)*

3. *(Stay tuned for updates!)*

I'll be adding pictures, links, and more as the adventure continues. Can't wait to share my progress and discoveriesâ€”let's make learning AI fun and impactful!
